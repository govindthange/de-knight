# Crowdfunding

De-Chess supports crowdfunding through `peer-to-peer` fund raising model that removes the need for intermediaries. The game's `CHESS (♞)` coins are exchangeable over peer to peer network.

This blockchain-powered fundraising mechanism offer a solution to tournament organizers who plan to commit resources, time and money for a chess tournaments by renting venue for conducting the match and marketing the same. With De-Chess' crowdfunding feature the organizers can test market acceptance and viability before committing the accumulated funds. This market knowledge makes tournament organizers more willing to take on the financial risk to arrange match that could be profitable.

## So how does De-Chess crowdfunding work?

When a potential organizer of a chess tournament presents the initiative of a new chess match, interested parties may choose to support the event.

Each supporter transfers the required amount in `CHESS (♞)` coins to an escrow wallet bound by a De-Chess smart contract. The creator can launch a tournament when the total amount in escrow reaches the target within a specified period.

## The 3 crowdfunding scenarios

1. Once a tournament is created, published and accepted by the majority of the donors through a governance voting system, the complete funds are released to the organizers.

2. When each milestone (such as renting a venue for a chess, or completion of a marketing campaign) is reached and accepted by a predefined ratio of supporters, then a portion of the funds is released to facilitate project progress.

3. When the tournament is created and released or made live for public, the funds can be released to the organizers with or without donor acceptance independent of donor acceptance levels.

The predetermined amount from the escrow wallet will be transferred to the creator once consensus is reached. In this way, the smart contract insulates donors against judgment errors from project creators.

It is a fully customizable smart contracts that defines the terms of the contract, the conditions under which funds are released to the tournament organizers. The contract allows donors (tournament audience) to choose campaigns offering terms they agree with. It also creates a transparent relationship where tournament organizers and donors are protected. Donors can safely contribute to their favorite chess tournaments. Audience can support any tournament and purchase digital products.
